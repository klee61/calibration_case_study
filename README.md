# calibration_case_study

The Python codes construct an operational coverage estimator and calibration curve for a toy example in "paper title" [arxiv link]. 

Starting from the simulation for the training set, going through the training process, and testing the proposed model at the test signal d_{o} (the test signal is generated without noise), the calibrated region at a nominal level of 80% is obtained and displayed in the plot. The results are slightly different from the paper as different seed is used here.


A brief summary of each code will be needed.
